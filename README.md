# Pokemon-JSON
This is an school assignment from our Web Authoring 5 class (MULT213). I used Pokemon data from a JSON file and parsed it into JavaScript to then display pokemon statistics and facts in a fun, unique way!

# Instructions

## Step 1 - Data

1. Download this zip file which contains several JSON starter files
2. Inspect each of the JSON files and choose one of them that you'd like to use for your project
3. Create an HTML file that includes a "div" element with an "id" attribute. (See starter code below.)
4. Create a new JavaScript file and imports the JSON data. (See starter code below.)
5. Iterate over the data and build a string of HTML that displays the data in a structured format.
  * This format could be a list, table, paragraphs, etc. Whatever you think makes the data looks best.
  * You must include all of the information provided to you in the JSON for each item.
6. Use the innerHTML property to insert the HTML string into the "div" element on the HTML page.
7. Test the program by running a local web server (or uploading to your own web server) and opening the HTML file in a web browser.

## Step 2 - Calculate

Add a section to your HTML that includes some basic statistics calculated from the data in your JSON file. This could include things like number of items, min / max, average, etc. 

## Step 3 - Customize

Feel free to be creative, and customize your HTML with a layout, CSS styling, and any general information about the data which might be helpful to users viewing the website.
